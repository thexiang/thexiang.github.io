# udacity
This repo contains my work for Udacity courses.  

gh-pages URL: [https://jefflirion.github.io/udacity/](https://jefflirion.github.io/udacity/)

Specific to **Intro to Hadoop and MapReduce**:

* The location of this folder on the Cloudera virtual machine is `/home/training/udacity`.  
* In my `/udacity/.git/config` file I had to change:
```
[remote "origin"]
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
	url = https://JeffLIrion@github.com/JeffLIrion/udacity.git
```
