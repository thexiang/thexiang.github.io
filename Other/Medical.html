		<p>This course will help you become familiar with the everyday 
vocabulary used by medical billing specialists and their peers. Medical 
billing and coding is a complex vocation that requires extensive 
knowledge of the healthcare system, medical terminology, and accounting,
 not to mention a vast suite of medical code sets. Understanding these 
subjects and the role that a medical billing specialist plays in them 
will bring you one step closer to starting a career in the field.</p>
<p>Because of the complexity of the medical billing field, it can be 
easy to feel overwhelmed by the subject matter at first glance. Let this
 extensive glossary of key medical billing terms serve as a reference to
 help you get a better grasp on the language of this field.</p>
<p>Check out the medical billing terminology definitions and explanations in the alphabetized list below:</p>
<h2>A</h2>
<p><b>Allowed Amount</b>: The sum an insurance company will reimburse to
 cover a healthcare service or procedure. The patient typically pays the
 remaining balance if there is any amount left over after the allowed 
amount has been paid. This amount should not to be confused with co-pay 
or deductibles owed by a patient.</p>
<p><b>American Medical Association (AMA)</b>: The AMA is the largest 
organization of physicians in the U.S. dedicated to improving the 
quality of healthcare administered by providers across the country. The 
current procedural technology (CPT) code set is maintained and revised 
by the AMA in accordance with federal guidelines.</p>
<p><b>Aging</b>:<b> </b>A formal medical billing term that refers to 
insurance claims that haven’t been paid or balances owed by patients 
overdue by more than 30 days. Aging claims may become denied if they 
aren’t filed in time with a health insurance company.</p>
<p><b>Ancillary Services</b>: Any service administered in a hospital or 
other healthcare facility other than room and board, including 
biometrics tests, physical therapy, and physician consultations among 
other services.</p>
<p><b>Appeal</b>:<b> </b>Appeal occurs when a patient or a provider 
tries to convince an insurance company to pay for healthcare after it 
has decided not to cover costs for someone on a claim. Medical billing 
specialists deal with appeals after a claim has been denied or rejected 
by an insurance company.</p>
<p><b>Applied to Deductible (ATD): </b>This term refers to the amount of
 money a patient owes a provider that goes to paying their yearly 
deductible. A patient’s deductible is determined by their insurance plan
 and can range in price.<b> </b></p>

payments made directly to a healthcare provider for medical services 
received by the patient. Assignment of benefits occurs after a claim has
 been successfully processed with an insurance company.</p>
<p><b>Application Service Provider (ASP)</b>: ASP is a digital network 
that allows healthcare providers to access quality medical billing 
software and technologies without needing to purchase and maintain it 
themselves. Providers who use ASP typically pay a monthly fee to the 
company that maintains the billing software.</p>
<p><b>Authorization: </b>This term refers to when a patient’s health 
insurance plan requires them to get permission from their insurance 
providers before receiving certain healthcare services. A patient may be
 denied coverage if they see a provider for a service that needed 
authorization without first consulting the insurance company.</p>
<h2>B</h2>
<p><b>Beneficiary: </b>The beneficiary is the person who receives 
benefits and/or coverage under a healthcare plan. The beneficiary of an

<p><b>Blue Cross Blue Shield: </b>Blue Cross Blue Shield is a federation
 of 38 health insurance companies in the U.S. (some of which are

has decided to pay for that service.</p>

received with a provider.</p>
